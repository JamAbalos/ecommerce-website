      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We selected the best Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grapes and perfected the art of the blend in a wine. Just two vintages later, Murasaki Wines won the trophy for the best red wine in the world at the International Wine and Spirits Competition in London, UK. Over the years, our Wine family has evolved to include best selling single varietal red and white wines which showcase the unique, rich terrior of Niagara. Rich, elegant wines that continue to earn awards and accolades in every vintage. Every bottle exhibits the skill of our winemaker, with the rich, smooth, refined character that defines Murasaki Wines.
