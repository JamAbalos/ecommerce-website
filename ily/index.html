    <h1>Dear Joe,</h1>
    <p>You are the first guy I ever fell in love with. I wake up everyday wanting to hear the sound of your voice, wanting to see the smile on your face, and receive the kisses from your lips. You're all I think about throughout the days, I day dream about your warmth, your kisses, and your touch, how I crave every bit of you.</p>
    <p>You are the only person who could make me smile with just one glance, the only man who I subconsciously stare at without realizing until I get caught, the only one whose words could mean so much to me. How you can make me forget why I was upset just by saying you love me, the way that you're always thinking of me makes me feel so special, I never knew how amazing being loved by someone you love could be.</p>
    <p>Through the hard times, through the boring times, through the lonely times, and even through all the painful times, I can get by just knowing that I love you. I love your eyes, your dorky eyebrows, your sweet lips, your adorable smile, your tall body, your every limb, and obviously your boys and the man. Obviously.I pretty much love your very existence.</p>
    <p>Thank you baby, for loving me even through all my faults, thank you for putting up with me even when I'm being unreasonable, thank you for trusting me and giving me your faith, and thank you for making me experience many firsts. I want to be with you always, I love you more than I love my icecream.</p>
    <p>Baby, I truly love you.</p>
    <p>So my cutie, my sweetie, my good looking man, my sexy beast, my baby, my butt, my only, my world, my love...would you please me mine this Valentines?</p>
